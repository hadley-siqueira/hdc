Haard is a programming language with syntax inspired 
mainly from Python, but the semantics are more similar to C++. 

This repository contains the source code for the first compiler
of the language, which is being implemented in C++. It is still in
development and can't produce a 'hello, world' yet.

## Install from source

1. Clone the repository
2. Enter the directory
3. Create a folder named build and enter it
4. Run cmake
5. Run makefile
6. There will be a binary named hdc in the build folder

```
git clone https://github.com/hadley-siqueira/hdc.git
cd hdc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
